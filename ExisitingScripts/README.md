# Original Scripts From Sam

The first NCL script plots outgoing long wave radiation (used to determine where strong thunderstorms exist) for multiple ensemble members [(see 'olr_ir_comparison')](olr_ir_comparison.pdf). The second NCL script averages the windspeed components (u,v,w) around the storm and plots how these averages change with time and distance from the storm centre [(see 'fig7')](fig.pdf).
