# Python Scripts

John Ashcroft [(windspeed_stamp.py)](windspeed_stamp.py) and Will Torgerson [(olr_stamp.py)](olr_stamp.py), which produce stamp plots of lower tropospheric windspeed and outgoing long wave radiation, respectively.

## TO DO

Run scripts and save output for later:
* Olr_stamp:
  * custom_cmap not included
  * need to swap pickles to run
* windspeed_stamp:
  * Runs in python environment
  * altered output location
  * VERY slow
